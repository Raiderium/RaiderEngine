RaiderEngine
============

RaiderEngine is a 3D game engine. It is currently not fit for human consumption and does not compile.

Quick facts:
Graphics via OpenGL (minimum version 1.1)
Dynamics and collision via the Open Dynamics Engine
File access via PhysicsFS
Windowing and sound via SFML
Content via Blender
A lot of stuff via DerelictOrg
Cross platform, tiny footprint, as simple as possible but not simpler
Genre-agnostic entity framework
I like icecream
