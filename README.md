RaiderEngine
============

RaiderEngine is a 3D game engine. It is currently not fit for human consumption and does not compile.

Quick facts: <br>
Graphics via OpenGL (minimum version 1.1) <br>
Dynamics and collision via the Open Dynamics Engine<br>
File access via PhysicsFS<br>
Windowing and sound via SFML<br>
Content via Blender<br>
A lot of stuff via DerelictOrg<br>
Cross platform, tiny footprint, as simple as possible but not simpler<br>
Genre-agnostic entity framework<br>
I like icecream<br>
